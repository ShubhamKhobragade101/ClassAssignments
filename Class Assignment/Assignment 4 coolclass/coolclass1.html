    <h1>Defining Coolness</h1>

    <p>Let's dive into the fascinating realm of coolness. It's a
        concept that each of us holds close, believing that we embody it in our
        unique ways. I, for one, am no exception to this belief. I confidently
        assert that I am cool, and here's why: it's not just the clothes I wear or
        the style of my hair; it's a way of life. My actions, my attitude,
        everything about me exudes sheer and undiluted coolness. I live it, I
        breathe it, and it even flows in my veins. Care to contest that I might be
        cooler than you? I'll make it simple; I am indeed cooler. </p>

    <h2>The Equation of Coolness</h2>

    <p> Now, let's attempt to quantify coolness. Coolness isn't a
        straightforward sum; it's a multi-faceted equation. It comprises 5%
        aspiration, 95% self-perception, 10% public awareness, 46% individuality,
        15% actions, 22% verbal expression, and 99% of what others think about you.
        Hold on, the math doesn't add up to 100%, but that's precisely the point.
        Coolness doesn't conform to such precise calculations.</p>

    <h2> The Ultimate Coolness</h2>

    <p>As someone who considers themselves exceptionally cool, I'll take a daring
        step (because that's what cool people do) and present my theory on ultimate
        coolness. Rest assured, my ability to state this opinion only adds to my
        coolness. But let's not digress for too long. Ultimate coolness, you see, is
        elusive. It's not something you can touch or hold. It's a concept, a
        perception, an attitude. It's about how you see the world and how you make
        the world see you. Want to put my theory to the test? Ask someone if they
        think you're cool. Watch them pause, their thoughts racing as they weigh the
        potential loss of coolness in admitting that the person asking might be
        cooler. Their response? Probably something indirect like complimenting your
        choice of socks or shirt, or a non-committal "maybe" or "depends." Coolness,
        you see, is an enigma that defies simple definition.</p>
