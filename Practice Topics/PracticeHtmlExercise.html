        Easy Explanation.
        Imagine building a house with different kinds of <b>LEGO</b>blocks. <br>
        MERN stack is like using four special types of LEGO blocks to make a website.<br>
        <b>M</b> stands for "MongoDB" which is like a storage box where we keep information.<br> 
        <b>E</b>  is for "Express" which is like the person who brings things in and out of the storage.<br>
        <b>R</b>  is for "React" which is like the artist who makes the website look nice. <br>
        <b>N</b> is for "Node.js" which is like the brain of the website, making sure everything works together!<br>

        Explanation for a graduated student:
        MERN stack development is a way of creating web applications. It combines four main technologies:

        MongoDB: This is a type of database where you store your app's data, like user information or posts. Think of it like a big digital file cabinet.

        Express: This is a web application framework that helps manage the server-side part of your app. It handles things like handling requests from users and sending responses back. It's like the traffic controller of your app.

        React: This is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It helps create the visual part of your app that users see and interact with. Think of it as the artist who designs how the app looks.

        Node.js: This is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript on the server side. It's like the engine that powers everything behind the scenes, making sure the different parts of your app work together smoothly.

        So, when you work with MERN stack, you're using these four technologies together to create a full-fledged web application, from storing data to creating the user interface and making everything function properly.
